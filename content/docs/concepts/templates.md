## Definition

Templates are the files available in a preset. They may be copied and modified by presets to modify the project the preset is applied on.

They can be organized however you want, but most presets will simply copy the file hierarchy inside the templates directory to the target directory.

By default, the template directory is `/templates` at the root of a preset project, but it can be changed with the `templates` option.
